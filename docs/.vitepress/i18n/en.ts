  history: {
    title: 'History of the Windmill in Tündern',
    intro: 'The so-called Dutch windmill on the Weser embankment in Tündern was built in <strong>1883</strong>. At first, the village\'s four bakeries obtained their flour directly from the mill. Until <strong>1960</strong> grain continued to be milled there for animal feed. Originally powered by wind, a motor was installed in an outbuilding as early as <strong>1921</strong> – an early step toward independence from wind and weather.',
    rescueTitle: 'From decay to rescue',
    rescueText: 'After the <strong>Second World War</strong> the mill began to fall into disrepair. Only with the founding of the local heritage association <strong>“Tundirum” in 1974</strong> did a new era begin. Thanks to numerous donations the mill was reopened in <strong>1979</strong> with a new roof and fresh plaster. But a year later, on the evening of <strong>19 July 1980</strong>, lightning struck. The mill was almost completely destroyed by fire – roof, fantail, cap and milling machinery were lost. Thanks to tremendous commitment and many helping hands, reconstruction was completed by <strong>1981</strong>. Since then it has been regarded as a landmark of Tündern and a popular waypoint on the Weser Cycle Route.',

    todayText: 'But today the <strong>ravages of time</strong> are gnawing at the windmill:\n- The <strong>wooden blades are rotten</strong>\n- The <strong>plaster is weathered</strong>\n- The <strong>masonry is damaged</strong>\nA comprehensive restoration is therefore <strong>urgently required</strong> to preserve this cultural heritage and make it accessible to the public again.',
    fairyTitle: 'Mills in fairy tales, legends and stories',
    fairyText: 'The windmill in Tündern lies not only on the <strong>Weser Cycle Route</strong>, but also on the famous <strong>German Fairy Tale Route</strong>. Have you noticed how often <strong>mills</strong> appear in old stories? Whether in the Grimm tales like <strong>“Puss in Boots”</strong> or <strong>“Rumpelstiltskin”</strong>, or in legends such as <strong>“Krabat”</strong> – the miller\'s trade always played a role. In earlier times, <strong>millers</strong> were seen as mysterious figures. Mills often stood apart from villages, outside social control. Many believed robbers would hide there – and indeed the profession of miller was long held in low esteem. Only in the <strong>19th century</strong> did the image change: mills became a symbol of food security and technical innovation. The windmill in Tündern is also such a cultural treasure well worth preserving.'
