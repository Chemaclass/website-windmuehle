# History of the Windmill

The windmill in Tündern was built in the **19th century** and served the local farming community for many decades. Until the **mid-20th century**, it operated as a vital part of rural life — grinding grain and supporting the region’s agricultural traditions.

After its decommissioning, the mill remained standing as a proud **landmark of the village**, a symbol of resilience, and a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of earlier generations.

Today, it stands not only as a piece of history but as a source of community pride — lovingly preserved and brought back to life through the dedication of local volunteers and supporters.
