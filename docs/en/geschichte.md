# 🏛️ History of the Windmill

The windmill was built in **1883** by the millwright **Redecker** from Börry, who was also its first owner. **Ten years later** he leased it to **Carl Lampe**, a master miller wanting to settle in Tündern after eight years of traveling.

## 🏡 The Mill in Family Hands

It is a so-called **Erdholländer** windmill whose upper part can rotate, which is why it is also known as a **Kappendreher**. The **fantail** on the back turns the sails automatically into the wind—essential because they only rotate when facing it directly. In Germany the wind blows from the west about **70–75%** of the time.

At first Carl Lampe paid an **annual rent of 350 Goldmarks**. In **1897** he bought the mill for **9,500 Goldmarks**. By **1900** he had built a house right next to it costing **13,000 Goldmarks**. For many years the Tündern mill served purely as a **grist mill**, grinding animal feed for local farmers. Lampe also ran a small farm, and when there was no wind the apprentice and journeyman helped out there. The work was very weather dependent and plans often had to change at short notice.

## 👨‍👦 Generational Change and Technical Innovations

Carl Lampe senior's son—also named **Karl Lampe**—followed in his father’s footsteps and became a **master miller**. He took over the business and modernized the mill:

- **1921**: installation of an **electric motor** so milling could continue without wind
- **1927**: installation of a **roller mill**, allowing flour to be produced

The **grist mill** and the **roller mill** operated as separate systems side by side.

After Karl Lampe Jr. died in **1968**, his son (also named Karl Lampe) **worked evenings in the mill** to support his mother. Although he had begun miller training in Aerzen, he had to quit because of a **flour allergy**. Shortly afterwards the mill ceased operation entirely.

## 🔨 Restoration and Current State

In **1979** the windmill underwent extensive **restoration**. Just a year later a **lightning strike** hit the upper section and the fire destroyed large parts of the structure.

Thanks to another **major volunteer effort**, the mill was restored once again. Today it is fully preserved and can be visited on guided tours—a living piece of village history.
