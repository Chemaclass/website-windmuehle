# History of the Windmill

The windmill was built in **1883** by millwright Redecker from Börry, who was also its first owner.  
Ten years later, it was leased by **Carl Lampe**, a master miller who had just returned from eight years of travel and wanted to settle down in Tündern.

## The Mill Has Stayed in the Family

The mill is a so-called *“Erdholländer”* — an earth-level Dutch-style windmill. Its top section can rotate and is therefore called a *“Kappendreher.”*  
Thanks to the wind vane (or fantail), the sails automatically turn into the wind — which is crucial, as they only rotate when facing it directly. In Germany, the wind blows from the west about 70–75% of the time.

Initially, Carl Lampe paid **350 Goldmarks** in yearly rent. In **1897**, however, he bought the mill for **9,500 Goldmarks** — a large sum at the time. He proved to be a successful entrepreneur: just three years later, in 1900, he built a house right next to the mill for **13,000 Goldmarks**.

Back then, the Tündern windmill was primarily a **grist mill**, meaning it ground animal feed for local farmers. Carl Lampe also ran a small farm, and whenever the wind was too weak for milling, the apprentice and journeyman would help out on the farm. The work was heavily weather-dependent, and plans often had to change quickly.

## From Wind to Electricity

Carl Lampe’s son, also named **Karl Lampe**, followed in his father's footsteps and became a master miller himself. He modernized the business further:

- In **1921**, an **electric motor** was installed to make the mill less dependent on wind.
- In **1927**, he added a **roller mill**, allowing the windmill to produce flour as well as feed.  
  Both systems — the traditional grist mill and the roller mill — operated side by side.

When Karl Lampe Jr. passed away in **1968**, his own son — also named Karl — took over helping in the evenings after work. Although he had begun miller training in Aerzen, he had to stop due to a flour allergy.

Eventually, the mill’s operation came to a halt. But in **1979**, it was **restored with great effort**. Sadly, just a year later, it was struck by lightning, and much of the upper structure was destroyed by fire.

Thanks to another incredible effort by the community, the mill was restored once again — and today, it stands proudly and can be visited as a piece of living history.
