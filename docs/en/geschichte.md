# History of the Windmill in Tündern

The Dutch-style windmill on the Weser embankment in Tündern was built in 1883. Initially the four bakeries in Tündern obtained their flour from the windmill, and later grain was milled there until 1960 and sold as feed to the farmers. Wind power could be used for drive up to 1941, although as early as 1921 a motor had been installed in a small annex to be independent of wind and weather.

After World War II the mill slowly but steadily fell into disrepair. When the local heritage club "Tundirum" was founded in 1974, it campaigned for a thorough renovation and restoration of the windmill. With the help of many donations, large and small, it was reopened in 1979 with a new roof and freshly rendered walls.

Late on the evening of 19 July 1980 a severe thunderstorm struck Tündern. Lightning hit the windmill and it burned almost completely. Roof, cap, fantail and millstones were destroyed. Thanks to incredible commitment and many helping hands, reconstruction was completed just a year later. As a landmark of the village of Tündern and a waypoint for the many tourists on the Weser cycle path, it again became a monument to old craftsmanship.

But now time has once again gnawed at the windmill: the wooden sails are rotten, the plaster has suffered from wind and weather, the masonry is damaged. Thorough repairs are urgently needed to preserve the monument and make it accessible to the public again.

### Mills in fairy tales, legends and stories

The windmill in Tündern is not only on Germany's most popular cycle path, it is also on the German Fairy Tale Route.

Have you ever noticed how many fairy tales and stories feature mills, the miller, the miller's daughter or the miller's son? In the Grimm fairy tales such as "Puss in Boots" or "Rumpelstiltskin", even in the legend of "Krabat", the miller's craft plays a role that is not always sympathetic. For a long time the miller's occupation was considered dishonourable. Thieves and robbers were allegedly hidden in the mills. No one could know exactly what was happening in the mills. They were watched with suspicion, as the mills were located outside the urban or village communities and were beyond social control. Added to this was the farmers' dependence on the mills to process their grain. It was only in the nineteenth century that attitudes changed and the mills became an essential guarantor for the supply of food.
