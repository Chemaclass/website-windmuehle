# History of the Windmill in Tündern

The so-called Dutch windmill on the Weser embankment in Tündern was built in **1883**. At first, the village's four bakeries obtained their flour directly from the mill. Until **1960** grain continued to be milled there for animal feed. Originally powered by wind, a motor was installed in an outbuilding as early as **1921** – an early step toward independence from wind and weather.


### From decay to rescue

After the **Second World War** the mill began to fall into disrepair. Only with the founding of the local heritage association **“Tundirum” in 1974** did a new era begin. Thanks to numerous donations the mill was reopened in **1979** with a new roof and fresh plaster.

But a year later, on the evening of **19 July 1980**, lightning struck. The mill was almost completely destroyed by fire – roof, fantail, cap and milling machinery were lost. Thanks to tremendous commitment and many helping hands, reconstruction was completed by **1981**. Since then it has been regarded as a landmark of Tündern and a popular waypoint on the Weser Cycle Route.


### Today: A monument in need

But today the **ravages of time** are gnawing at the windmill:
- The **wooden blades are rotten**
- The **plaster is weathered**
- The **masonry is damaged**

A comprehensive restoration is therefore **urgently required** to preserve this cultural heritage and make it accessible to the public again.

### Mills in fairy tales, legends and stories

The windmill in Tündern lies not only on the **Weser Cycle Route**, but also on the famous **German Fairy Tale Route**.

Have you noticed how often **mills** appear in old stories? Whether in the Grimm tales like **“Puss in Boots”** or **“Rumpelstiltskin”**, or in legends such as **“Krabat”** – the miller's trade always played a role.

In earlier times, **millers** were seen as mysterious figures. Mills often stood apart from villages, outside social control. Many believed robbers would hide there – and indeed the profession of miller was long held in low esteem.

Only in the **19th century** did the image change: mills became a symbol of food security and technical innovation. The windmill in Tündern is also such a cultural treasure well worth preserving.
